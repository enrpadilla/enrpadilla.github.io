# About Me

Hello! I'm Enrique, holding a bachelor's degree in mathematics with a minor in computer science from Sam Houston State University, and a master's degree in industrial engineering from Lamar University. During my master's studies, I conducted research under the supervision of [Dr. James Curry](https://www.lamar.edu/engineering/industrial/faculty/james-curry/index.html), focusing on developing software utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 API to summarize Likert scale data and enhance safety culture in the maritime industry. Collaborating with Dr. Curry fueled my passion and curiosity for Operations Research, expanding my understanding of its versatility and practical applications. Presently, I serve as a Quality Assurance Engineer at the Space & Geophysics Laboratory within ARL:UT, where I am continuing my passion for research and innovation. My experiences have solidified my choice to pursue a Ph.D. in Operations Research, where I aim to explore and contribute to the field.

## Current Project
Currently I am working on learning Julia by developing a software package of discrete and continous heuristic algorithms. Motivated by the increasing popularity of using Julia to solve operations research problems, my aim is to allow researchers to focus on research to absolve them of the intricacies of coding the algorithms.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python, R, Matlab
- **Data Visualization:** PowerBI
- **Version Control:** Git (GitHub, GitLab)

## Research Interests
- Software development for operations research tools
- Heuristic algorithms for combinatorial and continuous optimization problems
- Operations research applications in control theory

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item --->
