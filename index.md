# About me

Hello! I'm Enrique, holding a bachelor's degree in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science from Sam Houston State University, and a master's degree in Industrial Engineering from Lamar University. During my master's studies, I conducted research under the supervision of [Dr. James Curry](https://www.lamar.edu/engineering/industrial/faculty/james-curry/index.html), focusing on developing software utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 API to summarize Likert scale data in an effort to increase safety culture in the maritime industry. Working with Dr. Curry, I developed a deeper passion and curiousity for Operations Research and its versatility and applications. I now work at the University of Texas at Austin in the Space & Geophysics Laboratory
